## About

Are you struggling to leverage credit report data effectively for analytics and machine learning? Many loan origination systems provide credit report data in a cumbersome, fixed-length format. This not only hampers your ability to perform in-depth analysis but also requires navigating through extensive documentation and complex logic to parse the data.

Introducing our API solution â€“ the bridge to transforming traditional credit report data into a dynamic format ready for advanced fintech applications. Our software parses curated fields for both analytics and machine learning use-cases in a ready-to-use JSON format.

Unlock the full potential of your data with our API, and step into a new era of financial technology applications. Say goodbye to outdated processes and embrace a future where your data works for you, enabling faster, more accurate decision-making.
